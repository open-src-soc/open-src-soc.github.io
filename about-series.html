        <p><em>This page presents a brief history of these series of RISC-V events.</em></p>
<p>From the start, the main objectives of these events was to gather together hardware and software communities that could benefit from new collaborations enabled by the advent of open source hardware. If RISC-V was the triggering initiatve for the first people involved in the Meetings and then the Week, the expansion of open source in all aspects of hardware development was quickly seen as agame changer and taken into account.</p>
<h1>October 2018, Grenoble: The Very <strong>First RISC-V Meeting</strong></h1>
<p>The very first <em>RISC-V Meeting</em> was dedicated to <em>Accademic RISC-V opportunities</em>.</p>
<p>It was on invitation only, and took place on Wednesday October 17th, 2018, on CEA premises at Minatec Grenoble, France.</p>
<p>More information on this first edition –<code>not much though</code>– can be found <a href="https://open-src-soc.org/2018-10">here</a>.</p>
<h1>October 2019, Paris: The <strong>Second RISC-V Meeting</strong> and <strong>First RISC-V Week</strong></h1>
<p>Building on the success of the first, closed RISC-V Meeting, it was decided to improve the 2nd edition of the Meeting: expand it to two days, move it to Paris to reach a larger audience, open its audience to industry, and benefit from international speakers.</p>
<p>The program was still of invited speakers only. Tutorials and keynotes were introduced, but the format of regular sessions, three to four short prensentations followed by a mini-panel, was kept.</p>
<p>It turned out that the <a href="https://www.gdr-soc.cnrs.fr">GDR SOC2</a> was also interested in organising a RISC-V event, although more focused on scientific issues, at about the same time frame. We decided to join forces and gave birth to the <em>RISC-V Week</em> umbrella for the <a href="https://open-src-soc.org/2019-10">two events of October 2019</a>.</p>
<h1>March 2018, Rennes, Internet, Palaiseau and Grenoble: The <strong>Second RISC-V Week</strong> and <strong>Third RISC-V Meeting</strong></h1>
<p>The two days format of the RISC-V Meeting was found to still be relevant, just as the <em>RISC-V Week</em> umbrella to cooperate with another event. But due to the pandemic the original dates, 3rd-4th November 2020, were cancelled and postponed to Spring 2021.</p>
<p>We are discussing with a major player of the RISC-V community, and expect to be able to announce the full program of the Spring 2021 edition in early 2021. More details on the <a href="https://open-src-soc.org/2021-03">events page</a>.</p>
